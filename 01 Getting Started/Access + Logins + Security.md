# 2FA setup

*Any relevant info regarding 2FA should be included here. Explain how to set up 2FA for each of the necessary tools, or if this is all done already and is not the concern of the individual project owners. What users do/don't need to have 2FA set up, and why.*

# Other Authentication Quirks

*If there are any specific details regarding logins (shared access, ssms sa info, etc) mention this here. Some login setups for ad-hoc fixes are complex and can be confusing for first time users so be sure to state anything that isn't obvious here. This is more so meant for people who do not consistently work on the project. You may split this section down further if desired or if needed by the project. Think of this as your "free form" section to adjust as needed.*
