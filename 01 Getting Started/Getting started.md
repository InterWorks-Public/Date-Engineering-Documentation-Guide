*Encourage the reader to read the documentation (at least structurally) in its entirety on the first pass if they have not worked with this template before, to at least familiarize themselves with where things are found. explain how info is found, and other general "how to use the docs" info. *

# Contributing to the Docs

*Describe the process for contributing the docs, suggesting edits, or contacts for this. Any style guidelines should be included here as well. If your company has a setup already for this, list it here. This should provide foundational guidance for new documentation writers or project members being added throughout the process.*

# Tools, Dependencies and Access/Logins

* List any tools to be used throughout the project, as well as associated login instructions. You can instead just refer the reader to the separate "Access and Logins File if this is more extensive than simple logins. This will reference the later "Access and Logins" section. If tools require installation (on prem) give instructions on how to do so here.*
