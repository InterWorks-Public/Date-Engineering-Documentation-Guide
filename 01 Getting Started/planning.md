*Encourage the reader to read the documentation (at least structurally) in its entirety on the first pass if they have not worked with this template before, to at least familiarize themselves with where things are found. explain how info is found, and other general "how to use the docs" info. *

# Contributing to the Docs

*Describe the process for contributing the docs, suggesting edits, or contacts for this. Any style guidelines should be included here as well. If your company has a setup already for this, list it here. This should provide foundational guidance for new documentation writers or project members being added throughout the process.*

# Tools and Dependencies 

* List any tools to be used throughout the project, as well as associated login instructions. This will reference the later "Access and Logins" section. If tools require installation (on prem) give instructions on how to do so here.*

* -   *AWS S3*

-   Fivetran

-   *Snowflake*

-   *Tableau*

-   *Etc.*

# Contributers:

#List of people working on the project, and their responsibilities. This should serve as a "phone book" for anyone working on the project directly or indirectly. Be sure to add and update this section as needed throughout the course of the project.

# Terminology

*Compile a glossary of relevant business terminology, which forms part
of the business understanding available to the project. Constructing
this glossary is a useful “knowledge elicitation” and education
exercise.*



# Project Outputs

*Describe the outputs of the project to enable achievement of the
business objectives. What data will be produced? What pipelines need
implemented? Reports? This paragraph serves as the "answer" to the Business Objectives section*
