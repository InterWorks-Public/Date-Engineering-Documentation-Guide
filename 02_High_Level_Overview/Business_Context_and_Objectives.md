*Blip on understanding business goals being important to project. This file should serve as a non-technical overview of the goal of the project, as well as a few technical nods towards terminology that may appear throughout conversations. This document should prepare the reader to participate in discussions surrounding the project, as well as understand the goals of the company. This will enable engineers and analyssts to address the actual tasks at hand, instead of parallel questions/problems.*


# Background

*Any known information about the business and the type of data you'll be dealing with. Is there already a solution in place? What should
the new solution improve if there is one? This should serve as a field overview, as well as common data practices within this field.*

# Business Objectives

*Describe the customer’s primary objective, from a business perspective, as well as any future or secondary objectives.*

# Inventory of Resources

*List the resources available to the project. People, tools, other relevant documents, legal, etc. This type of field will appear in most documents.

# Requirements

*List all requirements of the project, including schedule of completion,
comprehensibility and quality of results, and security, as well as legal
issues. 


# Terminology

*Compile a glossary of relevant business terminology, which forms part
of the business understanding available to the project. Constructing
this glossary is a useful “knowledge elicitation” and education
exercise.*



# Project Outputs

*Describe the outputs of the project to enable achievement of the
business objectives. What data will be produced? What pipelines need
implemented? Reports?*

# Project Success Criteria

*Define the criteria for a successful outcome to the project in
technical terms—for example, a certain level of insight is gained. As
with business success criteria, it may be necessary to describe these in
subjective terms, in which case the person or persons making the
subjective judgment should be identified.*
