*Understanding the project’s business goals is the first step. As a data professional you must translate these objectives into a clear data problem and outline a preliminary plan. Since customers often have competing priorities, it’s crucial to identify key factors early to ensure efforts align with real needs. Skipping this step risks solving the wrong problem efficiently.*

# Background

*Record any known information about the business situation at the start
of the project. Is there already a solution in place? Describe any
solutions in place and why they are seeking a new solution. What should
the new solution improve?*

# Business Objectives

*Describe the customer’s primary objective, from a business perspective.
In addition to the primary business objective, there are typically other
related business questions that the customer would like to address –
include those here as well.*

# Inventory of Resources

*List the resources available to the project, including personnel
(business experts, data experts, technical support, computing resources (hardware platforms), and
software*

# Requirements

*List all requirements of the project, including schedule of completion,
comprehensibility and quality of results, and security, as well as legal
issues. 


# Terminology

*Compile a glossary of relevant business terminology, which forms part
of the business understanding available to the project. Constructing
this glossary is a useful “knowledge elicitation” and education
exercise.*



# Project Outputs

business objectives. What data will be produced? What pipelines need
implemented? Reports?*

# Project Success Criteria

*Define the criteria for a successful outcome to the project in
technical terms—for example, a certain level of insight is gained. As
with business success criteria, it may be necessary to describe these in
subjective terms, in which case the person or persons making the
subjective judgment should be identified.*
