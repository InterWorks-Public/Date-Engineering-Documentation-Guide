*This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and
requirements from a business perspective, then converting this knowledge
into a data engineering/analytics problem definition and a preliminary
plan designed to achieve the objectives.*

*The first objective of the data person is to thoroughly understand,
from a business perspective, what the customer really wants to
accomplish. Often the customer has many competing objectives and
constraints that must be properly balanced. The person’s goal is to
uncover important factors, at the beginning, that can influence the
outcome of the project. A possible consequence of neglecting this step
is to expend a great deal of effort producing the right answers to the
wrong questions.*

# Background

*Record any known information about the business situation at the start
of the project. Is there already a solution in place? Describe any
solutions in place and why they are seeking a new solution. What should
the new solution improve?*

# Business Objectives

*Describe the customer’s primary objective, from a business perspective.
In addition to the primary business objective, there are typically other
related business questions that the customer would like to address –
include those here as well.*

# Inventory of Resources

*List the resources available to the project, including personnel
(business experts, data experts, technical support, computing resources (hardware platforms), and
software*

## Software

*List out any relevant software*

-   *AWS EMR*

-   *Apache Airflow*

-   *Power BI*

-   *Etc.*

# Requirements

*List all requirements of the project, including schedule of completion,
comprehensibility and quality of results, and security, as well as legal
issues. 


# Terminology

*Compile a glossary of relevant business terminology, which forms part
of the business understanding available to the project. Constructing
this glossary is a useful “knowledge elicitation” and education
exercise.*



# Project Outputs

*Describe the outputs of the project to enable achievement of the
business objectives. What data will be produced? What pipelines need
implemented? Reports?*

# Project Success Criteria

*Define the criteria for a successful outcome to the project in
technical terms—for example, a certain level of insight is gained. As
with business success criteria, it may be necessary to describe these in
subjective terms, in which case the person or persons making the
subjective judgment should be identified.*
