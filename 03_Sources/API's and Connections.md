# Overview

*This document provides details on API integrations, authentication mechanisms, and data exchange formats used in this project. It serves as a reference for understanding how external and internal systems connect to retrieve and send data. This can be split up by source if you have many sources, or can be just one file if you have only a few. Remember to treat these as suggestions and not absolute truth. You may need to add more than what is provided, and you may find some of this to be overkill. Take what you want, and leave what you don't!*

# Authentication and Security

* Describe the authentication methods used for API's and connections relevant to your sources.*

  - Authentication type: (OAuth 2.0, API Key, Basic Auth, etc)
  - Token Exiry and Refresh Process
  - Secrets Management: where are API keys stored? Vaults, environment variables, secret managers, etc
  - Security considerations: Encryption in transcit, access control policies, logging
 

# Connection Types

*Describe the different types of connections used in this project.*

- Rest API's: Endpoints, request/response formats (JSON, XML)
- Database Connections: Snowflake, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc
- Streaming Sources: (Kafka, Streamkap, etc)
- File-Based Sources: (AWS s3, Azure Blob, SFTP, etc)

# API Rate Limits and Quotas

Define any rate limits imposed by external APIs and strategies to handle them.*

- Rate Limits: list them if applicable
- Pagination strategies: Handling large data extractions
- Retry logic: How does the system handle failures?


# Data Formats and Transformation

*Describe how the data is received and transformed* 

- Common data formats: (JSON, XML, Parquet, CSV)
- Schema evolution: How do changes in API responses affect downstream processing?
- Standardization & Validation: Are there any preprocessing actions before data is stored in cloud or data warehouse?

# Error Handling and Monitoring

*Define how API failures, downtime, and errors are managed.*

- Error codes & responses: How to handle HTTP 400s, 500s, timeouts, etc.
- Logging and Monitoring: Are API failures logged? How are errors surfaced?
- Alerting and Notifications: Are these automated alerts for API failures?
