# Overview

*This document provides details on API integrations, authentication mechanisms, and data exchange formats used in this project. It serves as a reference for understanding how external and internal systems connect to retrieve and send data. This can be split up by source if you have many sources, or can be just one file if you have only a few. Remember to treat these as suggestions and not absolute truth. You may need to add more than what is provided, and you may find some of this to be overkill. Take what you want, and leave what you don't!*

# Authentication and Security

Describe the authentication methods used for API's and connections relevant to your sources. The following topics can be subdived by source if doing all in one file, but my personal suggestion is always to split this up into multiple files (one for each source) as this will improve clarity, and wont take you much longer to find the specific file the source you are interested in.*

  - Authentication type: (OAuth 2.0, API Key, Basic Auth, etc)
  - Token Expiry and Refresh Process
  - Secrets Management: where are API keys stored? Vaults, environment variables, secret managers, etc
  - Security considerations: Encryption in transcit, access control policies, logging
 

# Connection Types

*Describe the different types of connections used in this project.*

- Rest API's: Endpoints, request/response formats (JSON, XML)
- Database Connections
- Streaming Sources
- File-Based Sources

# API Rate Limits and Quotas

Define any rate limits imposed by external APIs and strategies to handle them. This section can tie into any troubleshooting, and if rate limits are expecting to be met, this may be a wider concern that needs to be brought up with the client. Otherwise, linking your troubleshooting information for hitting rate limits may be linked here for ease of use.*

- Rate Limits
- Pagination strategies
- Retry logic


# Data Formats and Transformation

*Describe how the data is received and transformed. This will depend on Rest APIs, file based sources, etc. Try to not fall into too much depth here as this should mostly be handling by the architecture section. If you feel the need, you can link to those files here as well.  

- Common data formats: (JSON, XML, Parquet, CSV)
- Schema evolution: How do changes in API responses affect downstream processing?
- Standardization & Validation: Are there any preprocessing actions before data is stored in cloud or data warehouse?

- # Error Handling and Monitoring

*Define how API failures, downtime, and errors are managed.*

- Error codes & responses: How to handle HTTP 400s, 500s, timeouts, etc.
- Logging and Monitoring: Are API failures logged? How are errors surfaced?
- Alerting and Notifications: Are these automated alerts for API failures?


# Connection Failures and Recovery

*How does the sytem handle connection failures?*

- Handling Unavailable APIs: the syste retry, queue request, or use cached data?
- Database connection issues: Failover mechanisms, reconnection strats
- Disaster Recovery considerations: Backup plans for persisten failures
