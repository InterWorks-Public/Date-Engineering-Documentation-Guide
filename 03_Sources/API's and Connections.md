## Overview  
This document provides details on **API integrations, authentication mechanisms, and data exchange formats** used in this project. It serves as a reference for understanding how external and internal systems connect to retrieve and send data.  

> **ðŸ“Œ Best Practice:**  
> - If you have **many sources**, consider splitting this document into **individual files per source** to improve clarity.  
> - If you only have a **few** sources, keeping everything in one file is fine.  
> - These guidelines are **suggestions**â€”feel free to adapt them to your needs!

## 1. Authentication and Security  
Describe the authentication methods used for APIs and connections relevant to your sources.  

### **Key Topics:**  
- **Authentication Type:** (OAuth 2.0, API Key, Basic Auth, JWT, etc.)  
- **Token Expiry & Refresh Process**  
- **Secrets Management:**  
  - Where are API keys stored? (Vaults, environment variables, secret managers)  
- **Security Considerations:**  
  - Encryption in transit, access control policies, logging  

> **ðŸ“Œ Best Practice:**  
> - If handling multiple sources, **split this section into separate files per source** for better clarity.  

---

## 2. Connection Types  
Describe the different types of **connections** used in this project.  

- **REST APIs** â€“ Endpoints, request/response formats (JSON, XML)  
- **Database Connections** â€“ (e.g., Snowflake, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)  
- **Streaming Sources** â€“ (Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub)  
- **File-Based Sources** â€“ (SFTP, AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage)  

> **ðŸ“Œ Best Practice:**  
> - If working with a **newer team**, consider documenting **how** these connections are established.  
> - This is especially helpful for **ad hoc fixes** and debugging connection issues.  

---

## 3. API Rate Limits and Quotas  
Define **rate limits imposed by external APIs** and **strategies** to handle them.  

### **Key Topics:**  
- **Rate Limits:** Requests per second/minute/hour  
- **Pagination Strategies:** Handling large data extractions  
- **Retry Logic:** How does the system handle failures (e.g., exponential backoff)?  

> **ðŸ”— Related Section:**  
> If rate limits are **expected to be met frequently**, this should be escalated as a **wider client concern**. Otherwise, link to your **troubleshooting guide** for rate limit issues.  

---

## 4. Data Formats and Transformation  
Describe how the **data is received and transformed** before storage or processing.  

### **Key Topics:**  
- **Common Data Formats:** JSON, XML, Parquet, CSV  
- **Schema Evolution:** How do API response changes affect downstream processing?  
- **Standardization & Validation:**  
  - Are there preprocessing actions before data is stored?  
  - Are there validation rules in place?  

> **ðŸ“Œ Best Practice:**  
> - Keep this section **brief**, as deeper architecture details should live in the **data modeling or ETL pipeline** documentation.  
> - **Exceptions:** If you have a **custom script** (e.g., Python to convert XML â†’ CSV), link to the file here.  

---

## 5. Error Handling and Monitoring  
Define how **API failures, downtime, and errors** are managed.  

### **Key Topics:**  
- **Error Codes & Responses:** Handling HTTP 400s, 500s, timeouts, etc.  
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Where are API failures logged? (e.g., DataDog, Splunk, ELK)  
  - How are errors surfaced?  
- **Alerting & Notifications:**  
  - Are there automated alerts for API failures?  
  - What monitoring tools are used?  

> **ðŸ”— Related Section:**  
> This section should be **copied nearly 1:1** in the **03_SOURCES** troubleshooting section.  

---

## 6. Connection Failures and Recovery  
Define how the system handles **connection failures**.  

### **Key Topics:**  
- **Handling Unavailable APIs:**  
  - Does the system retry, queue requests, or use cached data?  
- **Database Connection Issues:**  
  - Failover mechanisms, reconnection strategies  
- **Disaster Recovery Considerations:**  
  - Backup plans for persistent failures  

> **ðŸ”— Related Section:**  
> This section should also be **copied 1:1** into the **03_SOURCES** troubleshooting guide.  

---

## Next Steps  
- If modifying an **existing API connection**, ensure the changes are documented in the **"Source Systems"** and **"Extraction Details"** documentation.  
- If adding a **new API**, ensure it is included in **monitoring workflows**.  

---

## How This Fits with Other Documentation  
- **["Source Systems"](source_systems.md)** â†’ High-level details on all integrated sources  
- **["Adding New Sources"](adding_new_sources.md)** â†’ Integration steps for new APIs  
- **["Extraction Details"](extraction_details.md)** â†’ Data retrieval and processing  

---

## Why This Version Works for Existing Projects  
âœ… **Keeps existing API connections in mind** â†’ Prevents duplication and ensures consistency.  
âœ… **Includes security & authentication details** â†’ Helps with access management and compliance.  
âœ… **Focuses on monitoring & failure recovery** â†’ Ensures system reliability.  
âœ… **Links related documentation** â†’ Provides a **structured** way to expand this document as needed.
