## Overview  
This document provides **troubleshooting guidelines** for various system components.  

> **Best Practice:**  
> - It is recommended to structure this as a **folder** containing **subfolders** for each topic below.  
> - This will allow for easier navigation and **more detailed troubleshooting** where needed.

## 1. API Troubleshooting  

### **Error Handling & Monitoring**  
Define how **API failures, downtime, and errors** are managed.  

- **Error Codes & Responses:**  
  - How to handle **HTTP 400s, 500s, timeouts**, etc.?  
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  - Are **API failures logged**? Where? (DataDog, Splunk, ELK)  
  - How are errors surfaced for investigation?  
- **Alerting & Notifications:**  
  - Are there **automated alerts** for API failures?  
  - What monitoring tools are used?  

### **Connection Failures & Recovery**  
Define how the **system handles connection failures**.  

- **Handling Unavailable APIs:**  
  - Does the system **retry, queue requests, or use cached data**?  
- **Database Connection Issues:**  
  - What are the **failover mechanisms and reconnection strategies**?  
- **Disaster Recovery Considerations:**  
  - What are the **backup plans** for persistent failures?  

> **Ensures** that API failures are **logged, recovered, and monitored effectively**.  

---

## 2. Monitoring  

### **Change Management**  
Define how **updates to source systems** are handled to prevent **breaking changes**.  

- **Source Updates:**  
  - How are **API version changes, schema modifications, or ownership changes** handled?  
- **Schema Evolution Strategy:**  
  - Does the system **support new fields automatically**?  
  - How are **breaking changes detected and mitigated**?  
- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Are there **staging environments or shadow tables** to validate changes?  
- **Communication Plan:**  
  - How are **teams notified about source system changes**?  

> **Prevents unexpected failures** caused by **schema and API updates**.  

---

### **Monitoring & Issue Resolution**  
Define how **source systems** are monitored for **data freshness, consistency, and failures**.  

- **Data Freshness Checks:**  
  - Are **new records appearing** on schedule?  
  - Do **time-based partitions align** with expected ingestion rates?  
- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  - Are there **unexpected NULLs, duplicate records, or missing fields**?  
- **Alerting & Logging:**  
  - Are **failures logged**? Where?  
  - **Who gets notified** when something breaks?  

> **Ensures proactive issue resolution** before failures impact **production**.  

---

## Next Steps  
- If a **new troubleshooting issue is identified**, ensure this document is updated.  
- If **modifying an existing API or source system**, ensure proper **testing & monitoring** is in place.  
- Regularly review **monitoring logs and alerts** to **identify patterns in failures**.
