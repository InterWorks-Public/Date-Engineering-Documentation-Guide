## Overview  
This document outlines the **data retention policies** for the projectâ€™s database architecture, defining how long data should be stored, archived, or deleted.  

> **ðŸ“Œ Best Practice:**  
> - Ensure compliance with **legal, security, and business requirements**.  
> - Define **clear rules** for **retention, archival, and deletion** based on data type.  
> - Implement **automated processes** where possible to enforce retention policies.  

---

## 1. Retention Periods  
Define **how long different types of data should be retained** before archiving or deletion.  

| **Data Type** | **Retention Period** | **Reasoning** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Raw Logs** | 90 Days | Compliance & debugging |
| **Processed Data** | 1 Year | Business reporting |
| **Aggregated Data** | 3+ Years | Long-term trend analysis |
| **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** | As required by law | Compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) |

> **ðŸ“Œ Retention policies may vary** based on **regulatory requirements** or **business needs**.

## 2. Data Archival Strategy  
Define how **older data** is archived for long-term storage.  

- **Archival Methods:**  
  - Move data to **cold storage (e.g., AWS Glacier, Azure Blob Archive)**.  
  - Store in **separate historical tables or partitions**.  
- **Access Controls:**  
  - Archived data should be **read-only**.  
  - Limit access to **specific roles or teams**.  
- **Cost Optimization:**  
  - Ensure **efficient storage** to minimize costs.  
  - Use **compression techniques** where applicable.  

> **ðŸ“Œ Data archival should balance storage costs and accessibility needs.**

## 3. Automated Deletion & Cleanup  
Define **how expired data is automatically deleted** to enforce retention policies.  

- **Scheduled Cleanup Jobs:**  
  - Use **database scripts** or **ETL jobs** to delete outdated records.  
- **Deletion Methods:**  
  - Hard delete (permanent removal)  
  - Soft delete (flagging records as inactive)  
- **Logging & Auditing:**  
  - Ensure **audit trails** exist for deletion actions.  
  - Store logs of deleted data for **compliance verification**.  

> **ðŸ“Œ Automation ensures that expired data is removed without manual intervention.**

## 4. Compliance & Legal Considerations  
Ensure **data retention policies** align with **legal, security, and privacy regulations**.  

- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  - **GDPR:** Right to be forgotten, data minimization  
  - **CCPA:** Data access and deletion rights  
  - **HIPAA/SOX (if applicable)**  
- **Data Subject Requests:**  
  - How to handle **requests for data access or deletion**  
- **Encryption & Security:**  
  - Ensure **sensitive data is encrypted** even during retention  

> **ðŸ“Œ Non-compliance can result in legal penaltiesâ€”ensure policies align with regulations.**

## 5. Data Retention for Backups  
Define retention policies for **database backups** to ensure recoverability while optimizing storage.  

- **Backup Types:**  
  - Full database snapshots  
  - Incremental backups  
- **Retention Periods:**  
  - Daily backups: Retain for **30 days**  
  - Weekly backups: Retain for **6 months**  
  - Monthly backups: Retain for **1+ years**  
- **Storage Location:**  
  - **Primary backups** stored in cloud (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)  
  - **Disaster recovery backups** stored in separate regions  

> **ðŸ“Œ Backup retention should align with disaster recovery and compliance needs.**

## 6. Review & Enforcement  
Define how **data retention policies** are reviewed, enforced, and updated.  

- **Review Schedule:**  
  - Policies should be reviewed **annually** or upon regulatory changes.  
- **Ownership & Accountability:**  
  - Assign **data stewards** to enforce retention policies.  
- **Policy Documentation:**  
  - Ensure retention policies are **accessible and up to date**.  

> **ðŸ“Œ Regular policy reviews prevent outdated retention rules from causing issues.**  

---

## Next Steps  
- **Review and validate** retention periods with compliance teams.  
- **Automate archival & deletion** where possible.  
- **Monitor policy effectiveness** and adjust based on legal or business requirements.
