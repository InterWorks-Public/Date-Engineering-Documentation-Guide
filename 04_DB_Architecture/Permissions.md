## Overview  
This document outlines **database and system permissions**, detailing **access levels, role-based security, and enforcement policies**.  

> **Best Practice:**  
> - Define **who has access to what** based on **principle of least privilege (PoLP)**.  
> - Ensure **role-based access control (RBAC)** is enforced to minimize security risks.  
> - Keep permissions **reviewed & updated** periodically to prevent unauthorized access.

## 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
Define **roles and their corresponding access levels** within the system.  

### **Standard Roles & Permissions**  

| **Role** | **Access Level** | **Permissions** |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full | Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) on all resources |
| **Data Engineer** | Elevated | Can modify ETL jobs, manage schema changes |
| **Analyst** | Read-Only | Read access to reporting tables & views |
| **Service Account** | Limited | Access for automation & scheduled jobs |

> **Always assign users to roles instead of granting individual permissions.**  

---

## 2. Database Access Policies  
Define **who can access which parts of the database** and under what conditions.  

- **Production Database Access**  
  - **Restricted to Admins & Service Accounts**  
  - Direct changes require **change management approval**  
- **Staging & Development Access**  
  - **Available to Engineers & Analysts**  
  - Can modify schemas & test ETL jobs  
- **Read-Only Access**  
  - **Provided to Business Analysts & Reporting Tools**  
  - No modification rights  

> **Sensitive databases should require additional security measures (e.g., MFA, VPN).**  

---

## 3. Permissions for External Systems  
Define **how third-party tools & APIs interact** with the database.  

- **API & Application Access**  
  - OAuth or API Keys required for **external systems**  
  - Assign **least privilege permissions** for integrations  
- **ETL & Data Pipelines**  
  - Service accounts must have access **only to relevant tables**  
- **BI & Reporting Tools**  
  - Read-only access **to predefined views & reports**  

> **Ensure that external systems only access the data they strictly need.**  

---

## 4. Access Request & Approval Process  
Outline the process for **granting, reviewing, and revoking access**.  

### **How to Request Access:**  
1. Submit a request through **[Company IT Portal]**.  
2. Specify **role, justification, and required duration** of access.  
3. Approval required from **Database Owner or Security Team**.  

---

## 5. Auditing & Logging  
Define how **permissions changes and access logs** are tracked.  

- **User Login Logs**  
  - Track **who accessed what and when**  
- **Permission Change Logs**  
  - Maintain audit trails of **role assignments & revocations**  
- **Incident Response**  
  - Unauthorized access triggers **security alerts**  
  - Logs should be **retained for at least 12 months**  
 

---

## 6. Compliance & Security Best Practices  
Ensure that permissions comply with **security and regulatory frameworks**.  

- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** → Users should have **only** the access they need.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** → Required for **privileged users & database admins**.  
- **Encryption for Sensitive Data** → Ensure database credentials are **not hardcoded** in scripts.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  - **GDPR / CCPA** → Ensure proper data access controls.  
  - **SOC 2 / ISO 27001** → Access logs should be **regularly reviewed**.  

> **Security compliance is mandatory—ensure all access policies are enforced.**
