# Troubleshooting

*This is very specific from project to project here. My suggestion is to have this as a subfolder, with well known problem spots as headers. Do not expect to cover everything in this folder, as it is not meant to do that. It is meant to serve as a guide for well-known or consistent issues. If your project is well set up, this should serve as a preventative file, not something the user should be accessing super frequently.* 

*Example Subfolders:*

- Source additions
- data conversions
- Schema changes
- etc
